FINAL PROJECT
Authors: John Bass, Margaret Luffman, Matthew Callahan

REQUIREMENTS:
To run this project, MATLAB r2021a is required. In addition,
version 11.3 of the Image Processing Toolbox is needed. Apart from those things,
there are no other requirements to run this code.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Run 'FinalProject' in the command window to open the GUI.

Use the browse button to read an image. The image will display on the left. Image information will display beneath the image.

Use the spinner to specify the amount of filters you want. This will create a number of dropdowns on the rightmost pane.
Use the dropdowns to specify filter types, then fill in filter parameters in the boxes that open up.

Filters can be enabled and disabled using the provided checkboxes. This makes it simple to compare
filter performances and view "halfway points" during image filtration.

When you wish to get a processed image, press the "Process Image" button. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY. I could have added that
but I think it would make the program a lot.

There are buttons to switch between viewing the original image and viewing the processed image. 
You can also view the FFT and histograms for each image using the tabs on top. This can help immensely when doing image processing work.

Use the "Save Processed Image" button to save an image.
